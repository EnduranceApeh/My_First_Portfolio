## 🧠 What I’m Learning

As part of my ALX Frontend learning path, I’m currently practicing how to:
- Create semantic HTML documents  
- Structure web pages using elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`  
- Work with text, links, images, and lists  
- Build simple web layouts using HTML only  
- Write clean, readable, and well-indented code
